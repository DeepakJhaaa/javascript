what is it?
Poly= many, morphism=form or behavior shifting.

why we need it ?
In programming, It is used when we want a function's (let say function X's) interface to be flexible enough to accept different types or number of parameters. Also, based on changing parameters types or numbers, we might want the function X to behave differently (morphism).

How it works?
We write multiple implementations of X function where each implementation accepts different parameters types or number of parameters. Based on the type or number of parameter, the compiler (at runtime) decides which implementation of X should be executed when X is called from some code.
